(Suggestions for another name are welcome.)
### Get it with the package manager from:
``https://github.com/cisco108/Gitinity_git_unity.git#upm``


# Get Started:

### The gui changed and can be found under tools now:
![Alt text](Assets/git_Un/Documentation/Images/14.png)
![Alt text](Assets/git_Un/Documentation/Images/15.png)
The following example using the old Gui is still applicable.
### 1. Install git_Un to your Unity Project.
### 2. Open the git_Un GUI (Window -> git_Un_GUI)
![Alt text](Assets/git_Un/Documentation/Images/13.png)
### 3. Paste in the http link to an EMPTY (no commits) repository of your preferred hosting platform.
### 4. Press "Setup git Un"
### What happens:
- The project gets initialized as a git repository.
- A .gitignore for unity projects is added.
- The provided remote is added to the repository.
- The entire project (minus gitignored files) is pushed to the remote.
- An additional branch is added for managing file locking.

# How to Use File Locking:
## 1. Drag the Scene File (only scenes are supported right now)

## 2. Click on "Lock Specified File"
## When this file is opened on any version of the repository, it will cause this message to show:

# How to Use Merge Function: 

## 1. Changes on scene file on <span style="color: #0000FF;">feature</span>
